# Raytracing
<br>The objective is to write a ray-tracing program in sequential and then parallelizing the same using OpenMP. Also, to calculate the running time of both the programs and compare the same.

<br>Both sequential and parallel are written in C++, and executed and tested on Cygwin
<br>with GCC compiler and OpenMP. This document will help in understanding how to
<br>execute programs, the output of both sequential and parallel, time taken by both the
<br>programs, and comparison between them.</b>
<br>1) Initial Setup
• Install Cygwin on windows system from https://www.cygwin.com/
• During installation, select “ http://cygwin.mirros.hoobly.com ” as a
download site.
• In the packages, select OpenMP, C, and GCC related packages.
• Finish installation.
• After installation, we should be able to see the g++ version on the Cygwin
command prompt.
